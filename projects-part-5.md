# Projects about GIS

## Cache

- [Go: Geocache](https://github.com/melihmucuk/geocache): geocache is an in-memory cache that is suitable for geolocation based applications. It uses geolocation as a key for storing items. You can specify range on initialization and thats it! You can store any object, it uses interface.

## Geo Database

- [Gaffer](https://github.com/GovernmentCommunicationsHeadquarters/Gaffer): Gaffer is a framework that makes it easy to store large-scale graphs in which the nodes and edges have statistics such as counts, histograms and sketches. These statistics summarise the properties of the nodes and edges over time windows, and they can be dynamically updated over time.
- [Tile38](https://github.com/tidwall/tile38): Tile38 is a fast geospatial database, spatial index, and realtime geofence. It supports a variety of object types including lat/lon points, bounding boxes, XYZ tiles, Geohashes, and GeoJSON.

## Computation

- [go.geo](https://github.com/paulmach/go.geo): Go.geo is a geometry/geography library in Go. The primary use case is GIS geometry manipulation on the server side vs. in the browser using javascript. This may be motivated by memory, computation time or data privacy constraints. All objects are defined in a 2D context.

## Other

- [OpenGTS](http://www.opengts.org/): OpenGTS is the first available open source project designed specifically to provide web-based GPS tracking services for a "fleet" of vehicles.
- [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/): GeoServer is an open source server for sharing geospatial data.
- [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/): OpenStreetMap 是一个由地图制作爱好者组成的社区。这些爱好者提供并维护世界各地关于道路、小道、咖啡馆、铁路车站等各种各样的数据。
- [GeoTools](http://geotools.org/): GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data.
