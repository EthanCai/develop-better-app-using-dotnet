# Projects about GIS

## Cache

- [Go: Geocache](https://github.com/melihmucuk/geocache): geocache is an in-memory cache that is suitable for geolocation based applications. It uses geolocation as a key for storing items. You can specify range on initialization and thats it! You can store any object, it uses interface.

## Geo Database

- [Apache GEODE](http://geode.incubator.apache.org): Geode is an open source , distributed, in-memory database for scale-out applications.
- [Gaffer](https://github.com/GovernmentCommunicationsHeadquarters/Gaffer): Gaffer is a framework that makes it easy to store large-scale graphs in which the nodes and edges have statistics such as counts, histograms and sketches. These statistics summarise the properties of the nodes and edges over time windows, and they can be dynamically updated over time.

## Computation

- [go.geo](https://github.com/paulmach/go.geo): Go.geo is a geometry/geography library in Go. The primary use case is GIS geometry manipulation on the server side vs. in the browser using javascript. This may be motivated by memory, computation time or data privacy constraints. All objects are defined in a 2D context.
