# Artificial Intelligence

## 开放平台

- [Baidu AI开放平台](http://ai.baidu.com/)
- [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/?v=17.25c): 微软认知服务
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/): Discovering and enacting the path to safe artificial general intelligence.

## Framework

- [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/): Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and by community contributors. Yangqing Jia created the project during his PhD at UC Berkeley. Caffe is released under the BSD 2-Clause license.
- [Google Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow): TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them.
- [Microsoft DMTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/DMTK): Microsoft Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit
- [Microsoft CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK): CNTK (http://www.cntk.ai/), the Computational Network Toolkit by Microsoft Research, is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph.

- [Angel](https://github.com/Tencent/angel): A Flexible and Powerful Parameter Server for large-scale machine learning

## 数据分析

- [Python: Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/): pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

## 工具

- [Python: PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/): Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration. PyTorch is a deep learning framework that puts Python first.
- [Python: Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It can use GPUs and perform efficient symbolic differentiation.
- [Python: Keras](https://keras.io/): Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
- [Python: Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Machine Learning in Python

## 自动驾驶

- [Baidu Apollo](http://apollo.auto/index_cn.html): Baidu Apollo开放平台

## Computer Vision

- [.NET: Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) - Machine learning framework combined with audio and image processing libraries (computer vision, computer audition, signal processing and statistics).
- [.NET: Accord.NET Extensions](https://github.com/dajuric/accord-net-extensions) - Advanced image processing and computer vision algorithms made as fluent extensions.
- [.NET: AForge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/) - Framework for developers and researchers in the fields of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence (image processing, neural networks, genetic algorithms, machine learning, robotics).

## Others

- [Aerosolve - Airbnb](http://airbnb.io/aerosolve/): A machine learning package built for humans.
- [golearn](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn): Machine Learning for Go
- [shogun](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun): The Shogun Machine learning toolbox provides a wide range of unified and efficient Machine Learning (ML) methods. The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. We combine modern software architecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing backends and cutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Machine Learning problems (yet) on single machines.
- [warp-ctc](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc): A fast parallel implementation of CTC, on both CPU and GPU.
- [convnetjs](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs): Deep Learning in Javascript. Train Convolutional Neural Networks (or ordinary ones) in your browser.
- [Gorgonia](https://github.com/chewxy/gorgonia): Gorgonia is a library that helps facilitate machine learning in Go. Write and evaluate mathematical equations involving multidimensional arrays easily. If this sounds like Theano or TensorFlow, it's because the idea is quite similar. Specifically, the library is pretty low-level, like Theano, but has higher goals like Tensorflow.
